Check out my friend [Dream](https://www.instagram.com/pranompopup/)'s short film, [*The Noodle Man*](https://amzn.com/B07SYCYL5N), on Amazon Prime (free for Prime members).

It's loosely based on his life - guy grows up in a family-owned Thai restaurant, then becomes a struggling actor who ultimately turns to doing [Thai food pop-ups](https://www.instagram.com/pranompopup/) to pay the bills.

Recommended for:  people from Lubbock who are familiar with [Choochai](http://choochai.com/) and/or Choochai Today, people who went to Lubbock High and know Dream, people in LA (where Dream was based for a long time), people in Austin (where Dream is based now - seriously, ATX people, go eat his food, it won't disappoint), anyone who's eaten Dream's food on one of his cross-country Thai food pop-up tours, anyone who likes Thai food, people who have 18 minutes to spare.

This film screened at the [2019 Rom Com Fest](https://www.romcomfest.com/2019/shortsprogram) in Los Angeles on 6/23.  It's also being shown at a few other venues around the country as Dream travels and cooks.

And hey, I'm in it (briefly; blink and you'll miss me).
