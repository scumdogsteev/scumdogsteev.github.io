I recently completed the <a href="https://professional.mit.edu/">MIT Professional Education</a> course <a href="https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/machine-learning-data-decisions-english">Machine Learning:  From Data to Decisions</a>.

This course provides an overview of machine learning and related concepts at the "mid-level" (not quite high-level, but not too technical, either).

It was a good experience that got me thinking about my work in some new and interesting ways, and I'm looking forward to digging into some of the covered topics in more detail.

### Key Takeaways

I've worked in "analytics," for lack of a better word, for over fifteen years, but I've never seen such a clear framework for how to approach a 
problem as this:

1. Understand data
2. Make predictions
3. **Make decisions under uncertainty**
4. Determine causal inference

Most analysts I've known do variations of this, but many neglect to spend enough time on #1.  Most of the work I've done has been in #1 (visualization,
primarily) and #4 (hypothesis testing and time series forecasting), though I've done #2 as well.  However, the discussion of step 3 will be especially 
helpful to me in the future, hence the **bold text** in the list above.
