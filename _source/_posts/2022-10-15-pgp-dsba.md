I recently completed the <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/execed/for-individuals/certificates/great-learning/">Post Graduate Program in Data Science & Business Analytics</a>
through the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/">McCombs School of Business</a> and <a href="https://www.mygreatlearning.com/">Great Learning</a>.

This sequence of courses provide hands-on experience with machine learning and related concepts using Python.

It was a good experience overall, and I'm looking forward to applying the skills I learned.
