summary: People I've met at INFORMS 2010
---

I've met several interesting people at [INFORMS 2010](http://meetings2.informs.org/austin2010/).&nbsp; I've even met (and reconnected with) some that are connected to me.

For instance, yesterday I met [Chung-Yee Lee](http://www.ielm.ust.hk/dfaculty/cylee/).&nbsp; Dr. Lee was the PhD advisor of one of my MS advisors, [Surya Liman](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ieweb/faculty/main/Liman.php).&nbsp; He told me that he is my grandfather; I'm not sure if that's entirely correct as I don't know if [academic genealogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_genealogy) applies to master's degree holders (and I didn't finish my thesis - my MS is non-thesis - so maybe I'm his step-grandson or something).&nbsp; Regardless, it was nice to meet him and I'm looking forward to [his keynote talk](http://meetings2.informs.org/Austin2010/plenaries.html#lee) tomorrow.

Then at last night's reception, I ran into [John Kobza](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ieweb/faculty/main/kobza.php), my other MS advisor, and [Tim Matis](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ieweb/faculty/main/Matis.php), who's a professor at Texas Tech that wasn't there when I was.&nbsp; Dr. Kobza joined us for dinner tonight.&nbsp; It was nice catching up with him and he gave me some good insights into questions I had regarding an OR career.

This morning, as we were leaving a session, my boss spotted [Saravanan Venkatachalam](http://id.tamu.edu/about-industrial-distribution/faculty-and-staff/215-mr-saravanan-venkatachalam)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿.&nbsp; Saravanan worked in our group from 2005 to 2007 or so﻿﻿.&nbsp; He and I worked closely on some projects and we were co-authors on [an INFORMS presentation in 2005](http://steve.mylesandmyles.info/post/529327281/informs-2005-presentations), but I'd never met him in person.&nbsp; He's now at Texas A&amp;M, where he's about to start the [PhD program in Industrial Engineering](http://ise.tamu.edu/academic/graduate/degrees_offered.html).
