**“Inventory Control for Automated Drug Dispensing Machines: A Service Level Policy”** (corresponding author, along with J. Kobza, S. Dunagan, G. Heath, and S. Liman) was presented at [INFORMS Seattle 2007](http://meetings2.informs.org/Seattle07/ "INFORMS Seattle 2007")

**Abstract:**  The authors present a service level inventory policy for automated drug dispensing machines.  Through simulation, it is shown that there could be a significant reduction in pharmaceutical shortages for a case study hospital.  A pilot study was also performed to validate the simulation results.  The model performed well compared to theoretical predictions and pre-implementation data.
