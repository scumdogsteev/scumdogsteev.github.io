-[ **background** ]-

[This mapping tool](http://m.maploco.com/visited-states/) has been making the social media rounds lately.  It's pretty cool but I like to see statistics.  As such, I decided to create [a ](https://public.tableausoftware.com/shared/F6PD9GSWH?:display_count=no)[Tableau version](https://public.tableausoftware.com/shared/F6PD9GSWH?:display_count=no) for myself.

-[ **interactive map** ]-

This shows countries and states (or regions/provinces) that I've visited as well as (very generally) how long I've spent there.  I will update this in the future, when/if I go elsewhere.  (This would probably be more impressive if I'd been to more countries and/or US states.)
