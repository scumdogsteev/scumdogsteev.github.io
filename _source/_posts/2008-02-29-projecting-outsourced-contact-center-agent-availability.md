**“Projecting Outsourced Contact Center Agent Availability”** by S. Myles, V. Buraparate, and S. Kumar G was presented at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/)’s [Wharton](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) [Financial Institutions Center](http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/) [Contact Center Forum 2008](http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/Contact%20Center%20Forum%20Agenda%20-%20Feb%202008.pdf).

**Abstract:**&nbsp; The authors propose a systematic, objective, and repeatable process for analyzing and measuring the staffing process and determining the agent workforce available at an outsourced contact center. The goal of this process is to determine the actual agent workforce at an outsourced contact center at a given time to allow for optimized capacity planning. As a result, staffing processes at various outsourced contact centers can easily be compared and capacity plans can be adjusted. The process begins with agent recruiting and can take several months to see results.
