**[Lognormality][log] is my new blog.**

**Why did I create this when I've had a [tumblr][mem] for years and used it as
a blog from time to time?**  

The idea is for this to be more "professional" and
[Memorylessness][mem] (my tumblr) to be more "fun." I've imported some posts 
from there (where they continue to reside -- redundant, I know), focusing on 
those about what I've created/done related to analytics/operations research.

Going forward, this will feature analytics projects and such while 
[Memorylessness][mem] will continue to feature other projects, movie posters,
videos (including [ones I've taken][vid]), etc.

This blog probably won't be updated very frequently (if the last couple of
years are any indication; there was one post that fit the above criteria
in 2016 and there has been only one so far in 2017).

**What's with the name?**

I named my tumblr [Memorylessness][mem] a long time ago because I'm fascinated
by the concept of memorylessness.  When coming up with names for other sites,
I've continued the "math nerd" theme from time to time.

**My various sites**

* [Main][main] - main site
* [Lognormality][log] - this blog
* [Memorylessness][mem] - main tumblr
* [Myles and Myles][myles] - running-related posts
* [Stochasticity][stoch] - my photos
* [Leptokurticity][lepto] - beer-related posts (mostly photos)
* [SCUMDOG Entertainment][scumdog] - portfolio of book covers, 
  etc. that I've designed
