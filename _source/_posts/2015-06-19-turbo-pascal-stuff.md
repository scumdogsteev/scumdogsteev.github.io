summary: Some Turbo Pascal procedures I wrote in high school computer science class
---

-[ **background** ]-

I took computer science in high school (mid-1990s) and learned [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Turbo_Pascal "Turbo_Pascal").  I was also [still using](http://steve.mylesandmyles.info/projects/tic-tac-toe/) Turbo Pascal [in graduate school](http://steve.mylesandmyles.info/projects/stochastic-inventory-control/).

"**Turbo Pascal Stuff**" is [a repository](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/turbo-pascal-stuff) of procedures and simple programs that I wrote and either found useful at the time or figured someone somewhere might find a use for now.

Unfortunately, these files aren't very well commented, though the procedure names are fairly self-explanatory.  When/if I add more files, I might work on that.  If you have any questions about them, please leave a comment below.
