On Saturday 9/8, I participated in the&nbsp;[University of Houston](http://www.uh.edu/)'s "[Maximizing Your Power Weekend](http://www0.egr.uh.edu/promes/events/events.html)," which is "the annual fall semester Welcome and Orientation event for" the Program for Mastery in Engineering Studies ([PROMES](http://www.egr.uh.edu/promes/)).

I gave a presentation entitled "[Storytelling for Engineers](http://bug.egr.uh.edu/pipermail/uh-promes/2012-August/000020.html)," as storytelling is a skill that I wish I'd learned in school. &nbsp;Thanks to those who came out and listened to my talk!
