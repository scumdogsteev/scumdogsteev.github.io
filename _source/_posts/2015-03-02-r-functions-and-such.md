summary: R functions I've found useful
---

-[ **background** ]-

"**R Functions and Such**" is [a repository](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such) of [R](http://www.r-project.org/) scripts for functions that I've found useful and I don't want to have to find or recreate when/if I need them again.  As I work more with R, I will add additional scripts to this repo.  Some of these are offshoots of the projects I'm doing for the [Data Science Specialization](http://steve.mylesandmyles.info/projects/datasciencecoursera/).

-[ **scripts** ]-

Scripts can be found [here](http://stevemyles.site/R-functions-and-such) or in the repository [here](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such/tree/gh-pages/scripts) .
