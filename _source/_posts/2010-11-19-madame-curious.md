[I mentioned previously]({{ site.blog-url }}/2010/madame-curious-is-coming-to-visit/) that [Madame Curious](http://madamecurious1.pbworks.com/) was coming to visit me as part of a [National Lab Day](http://www.nationallabday.org/) project.&nbsp; She is traveling the country to learn about what scientists, engineers, and others with technical backgrounds do so she can teach it to the fifth grade science classes at Harold S. Winograd K8 School in Greeley, Colorado.&nbsp; I taught her about my job as an Operations Research Analyst when she was here for the second half of October.&nbsp; Madame Curious [wrote about her visit](http://madamecurious1.pbworks.com/w/page/32833131/Hewlett-Packard,%20Houston,%20TX).
