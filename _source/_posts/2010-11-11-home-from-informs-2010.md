I got home from [INFORMS 2010](http://meetings2.informs.org/austin2010/) yesterday.&nbsp; It was a good conference.&nbsp; I learned a lot and met some interesting people, but I'm glad to be home.

On Tuesday evening, I met [Kay-Yut Chen](http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Kay-Yut_Chen/).&nbsp; He's an economist at HP Labs, and he wrote a book called [_Secrets of the Moneylab_](http://www.secretsofthemoneylab.com/):

> _Secrets of the Moneylab_ offers practical lessons being put to use right now at HP and other leading companies. It explains, for instance, how to:
> 
> *   Use      incentives to influence employees, suppliers, and buyers
> *   Determine      whom to trust, and how much
> *   Reduce      the negative effects of irrational behavior by  noticing patterns that      don’t seem logical—but are utterly  predictable
> *   Overcome      the human tendency to game the system
> *   Profit from motives beyond money

I'm looking forward to reading it.&nbsp; While I'm guessing it's directed at a firm's management, I'm sure it will be interesting.
