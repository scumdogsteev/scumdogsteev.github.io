<p>Check out my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pranompopup/">Dream</a>’s short film, <a href="https://amzn.com/B07SYCYL5N"><em>The Noodle Man</em></a>, on Amazon Prime (free for Prime members).</p>

<p>It’s loosely based on his life - guy grows up in a family-owned Thai restaurant, then becomes a struggling actor who ultimately turns to doing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pranompopup/">Thai food pop-ups</a> to pay the bills.</p>

<p>Recommended for:  people from Lubbock who are familiar with <a href="http://choochai.com/">Choochai</a> and/or Choochai Today, people who went to Lubbock High and know Dream, people in LA (where Dream was based for a long time), people in Austin (where Dream is based now - seriously, ATX people, go eat his food, it won’t disappoint), anyone who’s eaten Dream’s food on one of his cross-country Thai food pop-up tours, anyone who likes Thai food, people who have 18 minutes to spare.</p>

<p>This film screened at the <a href="https://www.romcomfest.com/2019/shortsprogram">2019 Rom Com Fest</a> in Los Angeles on 6/23.  It’s also being shown at a few other venues around the country as Dream travels and cooks.</p>

<p>And hey, I’m in it (briefly; blink and you’ll miss me).</p>
